## Quick Start

```bash
make deploy
```

### Features:
1. Creates the complete directory structure
2. Sets up basic Docker Compose configuration
3. Creates starter FastAPI application with security
4. Generates essential .gitignore rules
5. Includes a Makefile for common commands
6. Adds sample Dockerfiles and requirements.txt
7. Creates a basic README with project overview

To use the script:
1. Save it as `setup_project.sh`
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x setup_project.sh`
3. Run it: `./setup_project.sh`

After running, you'll have:
- A secure foundation with Traefik and Vault
- API Gateway ready for extension
- Basic networking configuration
- Sensible defaults for development

You can then gradually add functionality to each service while maintaining the secure foundation.
